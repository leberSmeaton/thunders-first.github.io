        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Last night Bella started a new course in front-end web-development through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>. It will be every Tuesday and Thursday evenings as to not clash with her attempts to find work. I've noticed Bella's also been coding on her phone with <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> and enjoying the challenges.</p>
          <p>I'm <em>extremely</em> proud of her will to push through and I know she's going to do <strong>great</strong> things. I know she can see her <strong><em>finish line</em></strong> ahead.</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If somebody would have told me a year ago that I would be able to make a website, I would have been like
            <em>'sure, that's possible'</em>. I needed a life change back then and I'm glad a shift has <strong><em>rocked
                my core</em></strong> and refocused my into front-end web-development.</p>
          <p>Just a year later, I am not just building websites I'm learning new languages and creating <a
              href="https://google.com">real online spaces</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Thoughts on growth and entering the Tech industry</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p><strong><em>
            The deep end of Tech, it's pretty deep isn’t it?
          </em></strong></p>
          <p>
            And so I jumped, well, more like did a run-up and a GIANT BOMB into one of the deepest pools of knowledge out there. Only a few days ago I 100% decided I was going to be in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Tech Industry</em> is a loaded term though, so much tech, so little time and I felt I was running out of it. I enjoy
            problem solving and learning new languages but which direction do I go? So far my mentors are telling me it’s okay to not
            necessarily fix yourself in one direction OR go for <span class="gold">gold</span> as a full-stacker.
          </p>
          <p>
            By chance I've met many senior developers across many facets of the industry, building my network. Their commentary has lifted me up, given me confidence and I thought <em>what is this strange embrace?</em> People actually wanting to see others succeed hadn’t always been a thing in my past work life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overwhelmed with starting options is an understatement. Eventually I just picked a couple basic free courses through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> and <a href="ttps://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>.
            The paid courses I am also attending are <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/workshops">SheCodes Plus</a> and <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/melbourne">General Assembly's</a> Part-Time Web-Development course. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            <strong>What is my goal?</strong> I am to build an online portfolio to show I’m keen, eager, willing, HUNGRY to be a developer! 
            And hopefully with that folio get a scholarship into a bootcamp as too fast track my career. The two bootcamps at <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/coding-courses/coding-bootcamps/fast-track/women-in-tech-scholarship?utm_campaign=CA%20-%20Code%20Academy%20Micro&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&utm_term=codecademy&hsa_tgt=kwd-41065460761&hsa_mt=e&hsa_acc=8075801785&hsa_grp=60539547282&hsa_ver=3&hsa_src=g&hsa_cam=1543273844&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_kw=codecademy&hsa_ad=326211609792&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETx2tiBZ25NrUc15BzBy8IqjuXL7YKJRZSiyKO1r_LBax6FjJIHW7YoaAqDUEALw_wcB&fbclid=IwAR39jn-NFFQ8sXFh-u7--EC-rSvxL4bksbzYOeqQPlhGzm4j2m-L1cL2wPs">Coder Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.myob.com/au/careers/graduate-program">MYOB's DevelopHer</a> also have scholarship opportunities which I'm gunning for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even this blog post is ground-breaking for me. I started as writing a goal for future me and now it’s a blog post. I have to say, I'm proud of myself.
